# Fresh-Soup
Vexcode V5 Project.


# Code planning:

First and formost there will be 2 versions of code. 1 version if we are part of the red alliance and the other if we are part of the blue alliance.  
Each version will be a different VexCode project. 

## File structure:

BlueAlliance:
    include:
        vex.h
        robot-config.h
        controller-mapping.h
        autonomous.h
    src:
        main.cpp
        robot-config.cpp
        controller-mapping.cpp
        autonomous.cpp

this is not final and this file structure will get updated as I add code

        <p> We have decided to completely redesign our entire robot. We have come to this decision due to our utter failure at the Mecha Mayhem Signature event in Calgary, AB.
            Here is a list of failure with our previous robot:
            <ul>
                <li>The robot had really bad controls</li>
                <li>Our intake system sucked; Disks had a tendency to get stuck on drive train motors</li>
                <li>We had no way of scoring in the high goal</li>
                <li>We had no way of scoring rollers(Although on the second day of the tournament we were able to scrap together a mechanism to score rollers)</li>
                <li>Our robot did not have enough torque to successfully defend against other, bigger, and heavier robots</li>
                <li>Random parts of our robot had a habit of falling off</li>
                <li>We found that strafing was really ineffective and just allowed other teams to push us around</li>
            </ul>

            To fix the issue of not having enough power in our drive train we are using a 6 motor setup with traction wheels instead of our previous 4 motor setup with mecanum wheels.
            We are also planning for this robot to be better for moving quickly around the arena and scoring roller and points in the high goal instead of defending.
            Instead a of a flywheel launch system we are opting for a catapult or other tension based launch system. We have noticed that all the teams that got in the top 16 at Mecha Mayhem
            mostly used a catapult for their launcher.

            Our current robot looks like this:

        <p> As new ideas and opportunities appear, we have been able to gain access to flex wheels which will help us in creating a more compact, flywheel launcher. A summary of changes we made in the past week-ish include:
        <ul>
            <li>Changed the drive train gear cartridges from the blue 6:1 to the green 18:1. We did this because the robot was hard to control in a confined space with the blue gear cartridges</li>
            <li>We also got a mechanism that will be able to spin rollers. This system is connected to the same motor as the intake to maximize the use of the 8 allocated motors we get </li>
            <li>We added some structural support to the robot; specifically the intake and roller mechanism as they had a tendency to oscillate and cause stress on the 4 screws that held the mechanism in place</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Some More Important Stuff</h2>
        Gear ratios for the intake and rollers are as follows:</br>
            The intake and roller motor has a green 18:1 gear cartridge. This spins at 200
            $$ \text{gear ratio} = \frac{\text{# of teeth on input gear}}{\text{# of teeth on output gear}} $$
            $$ \text{let } x \text{ be the roller gear ratio} $$
            $$ x = \frac{16}{24} $$
            $$ \text{output rpm} = \text{input rpm}*\text{gear ratio} $$
            $$ \text{let } y \text{ be the rpm of the roller mechanism } $$
            $$ y = 200\text{ rpm}*x $$
            $$ y = 200*\left(\frac{16}{24}\right) $$
            $$ y = 200*\frac{16}{24} $$
            $$ y = \frac{\left(200*16\right)}{24} $$
            $$ y = \frac{3200}{24} \text{ rpm}$$

            As we can see, the rpm of the roller mechanism is reduced from 200 rpm to ~133 rpm using a gear system(see figure 1.a).
            
            $$ \text{let } z \text{ be the gear ratio of the input mechanism} $$
            $$ z = \frac{84}{60} $$
            $$ \text{let } w \text{ be the rpm of the intake mechanism} $$
            $$ w = 200\text{ rpm}*z $$
            $$ w = 200*\left(\frac{84}{60}\right) $$
            $$ w = 200*\frac{84}{60} $$
            $$ w = \frac{\left(200*84\right)}{60} $$
            $$ w = \frac{16800}{60} $$
            $$ w = 280 \text{ rpm} $$

            According to the above calculations, rpm increased from 200 rpm to 280 rpm using a gear system(see figure 1.b)
